# DarkHeresySimulations
Script for DH2e dice simulations

### Usage
The script has an argparser - assuming the right libraries are present the argparser gives all the instructions required.
For example, python3 dice_rollers.py will roll dice using the default values. Recommended is to use over 10000 rolls to level the random seeding as much as possible without causing massive memory overhead, which can happen if you simulate a large amount (over a million) of rolls.


### When I work on this project
Well, not a lot as of now. For the summer I'd like to get back into this and refactor like half of the things here. Maybe make a class based implementation, add a GUI. Stuff like that. Not sure when that'll happen but it's on my mind again so hope to get back to this project soon.
