# DarkHeresySimulations
Script for DH2e dice simulations

### Usage
The script has an argparser - assuming the right libraries are present the argparser gives all the instructions required.
For example, python3 dice_rollers.py will roll dice using the default values. Recommended is to use over 10000 rolls to level the random seeding as much as possible.

### Future Features
I'd like to add extra features such as automatic histogram creation for damage dealt, changes in armour values of the target and more.

### When I work on this project
For now I'm doing this as something I code when I feel like it, so progress might be very slow. 
I'm trying to keep everything well documented as well so that's taking a good amount of time. Nothing beats best practice though.
