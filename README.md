# DarkHeresySimulations
Script for DH2e dice simulations

### Usage
The script has an argparser - assuming the right libraries are present the argparser gives all the instructions required.
For example, python3 dice_rollers.py will roll dice using the default values. Recommended is to use over 10000 rolls to level the random seeding as much as possible without causing massive memory overhead, which can happen if you simulate large amount of rolls.

## Future Features (far away)

### When I work on this project
For now, I'm doing this as something I code when I feel like it, so progress might be very slow (currently going fast as of 18/11/2022). 
I'm trying to keep everything well documented as well so that's taking a good amount of time. Nothing beats best practice though. 
Not sure if this ever turns out as an interesting project, but might refer to this as a portfolio piece at some point.
