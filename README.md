# DarkHeresySimulations
Script for DH2e dice simulations

### Usage
The script has an argparser - assuming the right libraries are present the argparser gives all the instructions required.
For example, python3 dice_rollers.py will roll dice using the default values. Recommended is to use over 10000 rolls to level the random seeding as much as possible without causing massive memory overhead, which can happen if you simulate a large amount of rolls.

## Future Features (far away)
GUI

Comparing damage for differing target numbers

Plotting multiple histograms for damage comparison

### Weapon Qualities to add (short term)
Unnatural Toughness - and Felling by extension

Lance

Melta

Vengeful

Twin Linked

### Other features I want to add (midterm)
Power fields

Comparison of damage from different firing modes, such as single shot against multi round bursts. This is mainly 
interesting for weapons that have different firing modes, which wasn't the original intent of using this script.

Improving histograms to show more info, such as expected damage per shot, clip, and hit.

### When I work on this project
For now, I'm doing this as something I code when I feel like it, so progress might be very slow (currently going fast as of 18/11/2022). 
I'm trying to keep everything well documented as well so that's taking a good amount of time. Nothing beats best practice though. 
Not sure if this ever turns out as an interesting project, but might refer to this as a portfolio piece at some point.
