### Other features I want to add (midterm)
Power fields

Comparison of damage from different firing modes, such as single shot against multi round bursts. This is mainly 
interesting for weapons that have different firing modes, which wasn't the original intent of using this script.

Improving histograms to show more info, such as expected damage per shot, clip, and hit.
